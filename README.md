# AmazonWishlistTracker

<h2> Program Info </h2>

NOTE: To enter your amazon wishlist to this program, you need to edit this file and put your link into the `amazon_wishlist_url` variable.

This is a simple program that scrapes the Amazon wishlist url, and gets the prices and the titles of each item in your wishlist. This program also mails you when an item's price is dropped more than the `threshold_percentgae` percentage value.

To run this program, obviously, you need to have python3 installed in your local machine. To run this script, you need to to go the directory of this script from your terminal and type `python3 main.py` or `python main.py` depending on your preference.

You need to install lxml module in order to properly scrape the website. To install it, you can type `[YOUR PIP VERSION] install lxml` in your terminal or cmd
